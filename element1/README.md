# Element 1 - Transportation System Characteristics

## Getting the Data
Head to [the RDE](https://www.its-rde.net/) and make an account. Then navigate to [the Pasadena data environment](https://www.its-rde.net/data/showds?dataEnvironmentNumber=10006) and download the following datasets:

 - 05i Simulated Link Volumes (Plain text format)
   * Simulated\_Link\_Volumes\_text\_10/01.zip
 - 06d Link Speed (Plain text format)
   * LinkSpeed\_Text\_2011/10/01.zip

Once all the files have been downloaded, extract the files from the zips/folders that the RDE packages them in.  Then place only the zips into this directory. **NOTE: When you extract and move the zips from the rdedownload any file name that contains "/" above will be replaced by "_" Do not change the file names.**

The other main component of the source data is `highway_links.geojson`, a [GeoJSON](geojson.org) file generated by taking a subset of the original Pasadena links shapefile in the [01 Network Definition data set](https://www.its-rde.net/data/showdf?dataSetNumber=10053).  To run the spatial query used to take the subset and export the shapefile to GeoJSON, we used [QGIS](http://qgis.org).

## Running the Scripts

The script to generate the data is a bash script, which should run without a problem on Linux or OS X;  Windows users will need to provide a POSIX-like environment by installing something like [Cygwin](https://www.cygwin.com/).

Run `./load_data.sh`.  This will populate the `data/` directory with subsetted and cleaned data for the visualization.

Note: we manually deleted a couple of links from the version of `highway_links.geojson` used for the visualization, because they weren't connected to any other links and looked distracting.
